<h1>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</h1>

<p>I had more, but you go ahead. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! They're like sex, except I'm having them! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Shut up and take my money! You are the last hope of the universe. Bender, we're trying our best. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. How much did you make me? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I'll get my kit! Shinier than yours, meatbag.</p>

<h2>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</h2>

<p>Ummmâ€¦to eBay? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? And until then, I can never die? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Oh God, what have I done? Large bet on myself in round one. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. It doesn't look so shiny to me. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
