<h3>Intent and Thought Process</h3>
<p>I am very into Rally racing and the Dirt series. It's something I have always wanted to do, but just haven't had the resources for. The new Dirt game that 
just released in February is titled Dirt Rally 2.0. I thought this would be a really cool piece of media to base a trailer off of. I wanted to make an intense, high energy, and high octane type trailer to show how insane this motorsport can be. I wanted the viewer to realize how fast things are in the game, and equate that to how mental these skilled drivers are in real life. I chose a pretty upbeat song so that I could do consecutive quick cuts and have that match up with the music. There are a few quieter parts as well to give the viewer a break from all the intense driving going on. I did a few different effects but ShotCut is somewhat limited compared to Adobe Premiere. Some of the clips I used had cuts in them already, so I was sure to have more than 10 that were completely my own and added by me. In the end I used 5 different source videos. I used a countdown effect right in the beginning, as well as a waveform overlay and some fades.</p>
